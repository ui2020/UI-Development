            <p>Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[24] T
                heir long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region
                 highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[25] Settled life emerged on the subcontinent 
                 in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley 
                 Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[26] By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, 
                 had diffused into India from the northwest, unfolding as the language of the Rigveda, and recording the dawning of Hinduism 
                 in India.[27] The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern regions.[28] By 400 BCE, stratification an
                 d exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism,[29] and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unli
                 nked to heredity.[30] Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ga
                 nges Basin.[31] Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity,[32] but also marked by the declining st
                 atus of women,[33] and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief.[g][34] In South India, t
                 he Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.[35]</p>
